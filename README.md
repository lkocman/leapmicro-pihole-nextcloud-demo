# linuxdays2023-leapmicro-pihole-nextcloud-demo
Config files used during my talk about Running Pi-Hole and Nextcloud on Leap Micro at Linux Days 2023

The nextcloud example is using quadlets https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/quadlet-podman
You'll want to copy the quadlets/systemd network and container configs under ~/.config/containers/systemd/

The demo expects that you're on Leap Micro 5.5 with podman 4.4+
